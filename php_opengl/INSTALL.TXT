Linux
-----

Build shared:

	cd php_opengl/glut
	phpize ; ./configure && make install
	cd ../opengl
	phpize ; ./configure && make install

Don't forget to use either 

	extension=opengl.so
	extension=glut.so

in PHP.INI *or*

	dl('opengl.so');
	dl('glut.so');

in your script.


Build static:

Copy 'glut' and 'opengl' to php4/ext/, delete the php4/configure file
and generate a new one with ./buildconf. Then compile with
'--with-opengl --with-glut'. You can optionally specify a base
directory for your opengl/glut installation:

cp -a glut opengl php4/ext
cd php4
rm configure
./buildconf
./configure --with-opengl --with-glut



Windows
-------

Included are MSVC *.dsp files. Copy them to your local PHP4 copy
to the php4\ext\ directory. Open them and compile for your build
target (Release_TS most of the time). You'll end up with
php_opengl.dll and php_glut.dll in php4\Release_TS. Copy them to
a directory where PHP can find it.

You'll also need GLUT for Windows available from
http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html .
